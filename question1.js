// Question 1: Normalize an Input String (Easy)
// Problem Statement
// Write a program that normalizes a given input string. Normalization includes the
// following steps:
// 1. Remove any extra spaces from the beginning and end of the string.
// 2. Remove any special characters and punctuation, leaving only
// alphanumeric characters and spaces.
// 3. Replace multiple spaces between words with a single space.
// 4. Convert the cleaned string to camel case (i.e., the first letter of each word
// is capitalized, and all other letters are in lowercase).
// Input
// A single string that may contain uppercase letters, extra spaces, and special
// characters.
// Output
// A single normalized string in camel case.
